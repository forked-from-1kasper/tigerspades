## TigerSpades

* Compatible client of *Ace of Spades* (classic voxlap).
* Runs on very old systems back to OpenGL 1.1 (OpenGL ES support too).
* Shares similar if not even better performance to voxlap.

#### Why should I use this instead of ...?

* Free of any Jagex code, they can’t shut it down.
* Open for future expansion.
* Easy to use.
* A lot of hidden bugs.

## Differences in this fork

* Support of big-endian systems (e.g. PowerPC).
* Unicode & UTF-8.
* Customizable key bindings.
* Cleaned up user interface.

You will need to compile the following by yourself, or get hold of precompiled binaries:

* GLFW3 or SDL.
* OpenAL.

#### Windows

Use MinGW-w64 from MSYS2:

```bash
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw mingw-w64-x86_64-openal unzip
$ make TOOLKIT=GLFW game
```

If everything went well, the client should be in the `dist/` subfolder.

#### Linux

You can build each library yourself, or install them with your distro’s package manager:
```
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev libglfw-dev
```

Start the client e.g. with the following inside the `dist/` directory:
```
./betterspades
```
Or connect directly to localhost:
```
./betterspades --server aos://16777343:32887
```

#### macOS

The development headers for OpenAL and OpenGL don’t have to be installed since they come with macOS by default.
